                        Natalie is a junior from Hong Kong, studying English with a certificate in Teacher prep. On campus, she is on the Varsity Women’s squash team and is formally involved with Camp Kesem and the Big sib Little sib program. She is currently an assistant coach for Princeton Junior Squash and has had experiences in teaching young students English, Math and Chinese. For the past two summers, Natalie served as the Residential Coordinator of The Lawrenceville Summer Scholars Program, where she spent the year developing the staff and organizational structure of the program and oversaw ~160 students during the summer. Natalie’s dream is to be a High School English teacher where she can influence teenagers in their formative years. She is also hoping to use social entrepreneurship to address education challenges around the world. As a boarding school graduate, Natalie is grateful of the privileges and opportunities she had been given and dreams to make boarding experience possible for underprivileged youth. In February 2016, she took Marty Johnson’s Social Entrepreneurship class at Princeton, where she partnered with Brenaea Fairchild 16’, to develop the idea of HomeWorks.
