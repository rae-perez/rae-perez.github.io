                        Natalie is a junior from Hong Kong, studying English with a certificate in Teacher prep. On campus, she is on the Varsity Women’s squash team and is formally involved with Camp Kesem and the Big sib Little sib program. She is currently an assistant coach for Princeton Junior Squash and has had experiences in teaching young students English, Math and Chinese. For the past two summers, Natalie served as the Residential Coordinator of The Lawrenceville Summer Scholars Program, where she spent the year developing the staff and organizational structure of the program and oversaw ~160 students during the summer. Natalie’s dream is to be a High School English teacher where she can influence teenagers in their formative years. She is also hoping to use social entrepreneurship to address education challenges around the world. As a boarding school graduate, Natalie is grateful of the privileges and opportunities she had been given and dreams to make boarding experience possible for underprivileged youth. In February 2016, she took Marty Johnson’s Social Entrepreneurship class at Princeton, where she partnered with Brenaea Fairchild 16’, to develop the idea of HomeWorks.

                    Jordan is a freshman from Lawrenceville, Georgia interested in studying Sociology or policy at the Woodrow Wilson School. She is currently learning Spanish and plans to study abroad in a Latin American country before her junior year. On campus, she is a member of the Varsity Women’s basketball team. After spending this past summer as a scholar in Princeton’s Freshman Scholar Institute (FSI), Jordan became a fellow for the Scholars Institute Fellows Program (SIFP) here on campus. In high school, Jordan experienced success in various areas. Jordan was captain of the Varsity basketball team, Editor-in-Chief of The Grizzly Gazette newspaper, and a member of the Gwinnett (County) Student Leadership Team (GSLT). On GSLT, Jordan organized school-wide events to promote leadership skills for first-year through senior students, and co-founded Bear Leadership Team (BLT), an organization that focused on developing student-leaders and a high-performance culture within the school. Upon graduation, Jordan hopes to eventually work to reform education policies so to improve teachers’ working conditions and students’ academic performance. She is excited to work with HomeWorks because she hopes to one day begin her own girls’ boarding school and recreational community center.

                        Ellie is a Junior at Princeton University from Tokyo and Hong Kong. She discovered her love for teaching in high school, where she led a weekly support and English tutoring program for Japanese children who were impacted by the Fukushima Nuclear Meltdown in 2011. On campus, you can probably find her getting lost in Firestone Library while doing research for her History papers, tossing around a frisbee with her teammates, or singing (out of tune) to the Hamilton soundtrack with her wonderful roommates.

                      Rae is a sophomore from San Diego, studying Architecture and Computer Science at Princeton. She has first discovered her passion for serving the homeless by working at a food pantry in high school. In the summer of her sophomore year of high school, she went on a brief missions trip to San Fransisco, where she got to hear stories from displaced people and this is a memory that continues to fuel her work to fight homelessness. She also spends much of her time tutoring high school and middle school students at Princeton Learning Cooperative, a local homeschool coop. According to Rae, education is incredibly fundamental to change within any community, which is why she thinks HomeWorks is a crucial addition to Trenton's public school system. On the HomeWorks team, she is in charge of website management and business plan development.
