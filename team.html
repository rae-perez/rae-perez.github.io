                    Jordan is a freshman from Lawrenceville, Georgia interested in studying Sociology or policy at the Woodrow Wilson School. She is currently learning Spanish and plans to study abroad in a Latin American country before her junior year. On campus, she is a member of the Varsity Women’s basketball team. After spending this past summer as a scholar in Princeton’s Freshman Scholar Institute (FSI), Jordan became a fellow for the Scholars Institute Fellows Program (SIFP) here on campus. In high school, Jordan experienced success in various areas. Jordan was captain of the Varsity basketball team, Editor-in-Chief of The Grizzly Gazette newspaper, and a member of the Gwinnett (County) Student Leadership Team (GSLT). On GSLT, Jordan organized school-wide events to promote leadership skills for first-year through senior students, and co-founded Bear Leadership Team (BLT), an organization that focused on developing student-leaders and a high-performance culture within the school. Upon graduation, Jordan hopes to eventually work to reform education policies so to improve teachers’ working conditions and students’ academic performance. She is excited to work with HomeWorks because she hopes to one day begin her own girls’ boarding school and recreational community center.

She discovered her love for teaching in high school, where she led a weekly support and English tutoring program for Japanese children who were impacted by the Fukushima Nuclear Meltdown in 2011. On campus, you can probably find her getting lost in Firestone Library while doing research for her History papers, tossing around a frisbee with her teammates, or singing (out of tune) to the Hamilton soundtrack with her wonderful roommates.

                      Rae is a sophomore from San Diego, studying Architecture and Computer Science at Princeton. She has first discovered her passion for serving the homeless by working at a food pantry in high school. In the summer of her sophomore year of high school, she went on a brief missions trip to San Fransisco, where she got to hear stories from displaced people and this is a memory that continues to fuel her work to fight homelessness. She also spends much of her time tutoring high school and middle school students at Princeton Learning Cooperative, a local homeschool coop. According to Rae, education is incredibly fundamental to change within any community, which is why she thinks HomeWorks is a crucial addition to Trenton's public school system. On the HomeWorks team, she is in charge of website management and business plan development.

                      Mofopefoluwa Olarinmoye is a freshman majoring in Chemical and Biological Engineering, with a focus on biotechnology and bioengineering. She also plans to pursue a certificate in Entrepreneurship. On campus, she is a member of the Princeton University Gospel Ensemble (PUGE), the Secretary of the Princeton Association of Black Women (PABW), a member of the Princeton Women in Business (PWiB) Events Committee, and the Sales Team Captain in the Institute for Chocolate Studies. Mofopefoluwa is passionate about female empowerment, she specifically wishes to improve female literacy rates in developing countries like Nigeria, her home country. Her ultimate dream is to create a foundation that connects more underprivileged girls with the books, resources and overall education that will enable them to expand their horizons, and better themselves and their families. She strongly believes in the power of education to break boundaries and change mindsets. Her love for education arises partly from her experience in boarding schools, in both Nigeria and the United States. A couple of years ago, she interned at LEAP Africa, an NGO in Nigeria that works towards developing the next generation of ethical entrepreneurs and leaders. While there, she aided the Programs Department in planning and executing their annual summer leadership program, targeted at secondary school students, which sparked her interest in teaching children to become intentional servant leaders.
